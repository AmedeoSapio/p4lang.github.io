As the new year begins, we wanted to take a look back and reflect on
all of the progress made by the P4 community in 2017.

## New Language Version

In May, the [Language Design Working
Group](https://p4.org/working-groups/) released [version
1.0.0](https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html) of the
P4<sub>16</sub> language. P4<sub>16</sub> retains the core features of
the original version of the language, now called P4<sub>14</sub>, and
adds new primitives designed to make it easy to write safe, portable,
and modular data plane programs. See the [blog
post](https://p4.org/technical-steering-committee/get-involved-with-shaping-p4s-future.html)
announcing P4<sub>16</sub> for more details.
 
## Portable Switch Architecture

One of the innovations in P4<sub>16</sub> is the notion of
"architecture," which separates the logical functionality needed to
express a given program from the components used to implement it. In
November, the [Architecture Working
Group](https://p4.org/working-groups) released a [draft
specification](https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/PSA.html) of the Portable
Switch Architecture (PSA). It defines a standard packet-processing
pipeline as well as a rich "standard library" of `extern`s. The goal
is to establish a common baseline architecture so that P4 programs
written for PSA are portable across a variety of hardware and software
targets.

## Flexible Control-Plane API

To date, much of the focus in the P4 community has been on designing
constructs for data plane programming. But in practical deployments,
P4 programmers will also need to write control-plane software. In
November, the [API Working Group](https://p4.org/working-groups)
announced the initial implementation of [P4
Runtime](https://github.com/p4lang/PI). It provides a common mechanism
by which local and remote control planes can manage a huge variety of
programmable and fixed-function switches. Google Cloud, Barefoot
Networks and the ONF <a href="https://youtu.be/BE_y-Sz0WnQ">demonstrated</a>
the first physical network running P4 Runtime at the SDN NFV World Congress. See
the [blog post](https://p4.org/api/p4-runtime-putting-the-control-plane-in-charge-of-the-forwarding-plane.html)
on P4 Runtime for more details.

## Emerging Applications

As P4 continues to mature, there is growing interest in applications
that change the way people design, build, and run their networks.  To
help nurture a P4 software ecosystem that is well aligned with the
needs of applications, we launched the [Applications Working
Group](https://p4.org/working-groups) in November. The goal of this
working group is to develop specifications and open-source
implementations of novel data plane applications enabled by
P4. Initially, the working group plans to focus on data plane
telemetry but it may broaden its scope to include other applications
as they emerge. See the [blog
post](https://p4.org/members/announcing-the-p4-applications-working-group.html)
announcing the Applications Working Group for more details.

## New Targets

This year also saw several new P4-enabled targets including;
* [Netcope P4](https://www.netcope.com/en/products/netcopep4)    
* [Xilinx P4-SDNet](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Xcell-Daily-Blog/The-P4-has-landed-SDNet-2017-1-gets-P4-to-FPGA-compilation/ba-p/766361)
* [Barefoot Tofino](https://barefootnetworks.com/technology/)
    
## Community Events

The P4 community came together several times over the past year at these events:
* A [workshop](https://p4.org/events/2017-05-09-p4-workshop/) and [developer day](https://p4.org/events/2017-05-11-p4-developer-day/) at Stanford in May,
* A [summit](http://www.sdnlab.com/19186.html) in Beijing in May,
* Tutorials at [PLDI](https://pldi17.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2017-workshops-and-tutorials#program), [HotChips](https://www.hotchips.org/archives/2010s/hc29/), and [SIGCOMM](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2017/tutorial-p4.html),
* A [Developer Day](https://p4.org/events/2017-10-16-p4-developer-day/) at Stanford in November.

# Looking Ahead

In the coming year we are excited to continue growing the momentum
behind P4. We are looking forward to seeing the release of PSA and P4
Runtime, and the development of novel applications built using P4. We
invite you to get involved. If you are not already a member of P4.org,
please [join us](http://p4.org/join-us) and help shape the future of
networking!
