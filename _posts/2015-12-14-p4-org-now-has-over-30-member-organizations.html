<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P4.org would like to welcome its newest member companies: Centec Networks, Comcast, Freescale, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft, and SK Telecom. This brings the total number of P4.org members to 33 organizations, ranging from academia to service providers, software, system and silicon companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s great to see membership more than double since the first P4 workshop six months ago.  </span></p>
