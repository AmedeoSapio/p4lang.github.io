<p>The P4 Consortium recognizes that individuals with whom we conduct business value their privacy. However, in order to provide membership benefits in this increasingly electronic world, the collection of personal information is often necessary and desirable. It is the Consortium's goal to balance the benefits of providing information and services via the Internet with the right of its members to prevent the misuse of their personal information.</p>
