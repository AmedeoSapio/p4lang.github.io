# Protocol Independent

P4 programs specify how a switch processes packets.

# Target Independent

P4 is suitable for describing everything from high- performance forwarding ASICs to software switches.

# Field Reconfigurable

P4 allows network engineers to change the way their switches process packets after they are deployed.
