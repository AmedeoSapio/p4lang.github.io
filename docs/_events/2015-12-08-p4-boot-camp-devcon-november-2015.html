<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately following the </span><a href="http://p4.org/p4-workshop-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd P4 Workshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on November 18 there were two hands-on P4 events: a P4 Boot Camp for PhD students, hosted by Barefoot Networks, and a P4/C Developers’ Conference (P4DevCon) hosted by Netronome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>P4 Boot Camp on November 19-20, 2015<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a two-day event where researchers from industry and academia came together to learn, create and share new and interesting P4 programs using the open source development environment, compilers and programs available on P4.org’s GitHub </span><a href="http://github.com/p4lang" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This event was oversubscribed with 28 researchers representing 14 universities and research organizations from 6 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the agenda and presentation materials on the P4 Boot Camp </span><a href="http://p4.org/p4-bootcamp-1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were lectures, tutorials and demos showcasing features and capabilities of P4 language. The demos included showing running P4 code for features like In-band Network Telemetry (</span><a href="http://p4.org/p4/inband-network-telemetry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">INT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Flowlet Switching, L4 Load Balancing, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers also got to take part in hands on lab sessions by going through example P4 programs (Source Routing, Flowlet Switching, etc.) and compiling them using the P4 development environment available on P4.org.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was also a panel discussion with Q&amp;A on day 1 with participants from the industry.</span></p>

<p><b>P4DevCon on November 19, 2015</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netronome Systems held an inaugural P4DevCon conference on Nov. 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2015 at the DoubleTree Hotel in San Jose, CA. The conference was a one-day technical hands-on introduction to P4 and C based programming on Netronome Intelligent Server Adapters and was attended by more than forty researchers from thirty universities and companies in eight countries. The agenda included keynotes from Jennifer Lin, VP at Juniper Networks and Niel Viljoen CEO of Netronome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary component of the agenda was a hands-on lab introduction to P4 and programming Netronome's flow processors in P4 and C. With the labs, attendees built a basic P4 data path in the Netronome Intelligent Server Adapter, followed by a custom tunnel processor in the Adapter, accelerated the tunnel with custom C code and built a "bump-in-the-wire" app entirely in C. The workshop concluded with research presentations from the university attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netronome also introduced </span><a href="http://www.open-nfp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open-nfp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a community site that will offer resources to accelerate research in network function processing in servers for applications such as network virtualization, traffic engineering, security, load balancing and telemetry. The recordings of the presentations at the conference and software and tools discussed and utilized at the conference will be available at </span><a href="http://www.open-nfp.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open-nfp.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
