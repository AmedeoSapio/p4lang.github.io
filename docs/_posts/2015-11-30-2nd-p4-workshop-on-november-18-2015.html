<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the strong turnout for the </span><a href="http://p4.org/p4/1st-p4-workshop-on-june-4-2015/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st P4 Workshop in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we held the </span><a href="http://p4.org/p4-workshop-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd P4 Workshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on November 18 at Stanford University. Like last time, the workshop was heavily oversubscribed again: All 200 tickets sold out three weeks in advance and 98% showed up on the day.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Talks and Speakers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the agenda and most of the slides on the </span><a href="http://p4.org/p4-workshop-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workshop web page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had over 20 speakers covering a broad range of topics, including:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changhoon Kim (Barefoot):  Chang leads the P4 design meetings and gave an update on where the P4 language is heading. He unveiled the latest </span><a href="http://p4.org/spec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">P4 v1.1 spec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is now available as a pre-release version (“release candidate”). Chang also listed some of the big upcoming topics for the P4 design group, to help developers write P4 code that is portable across different platforms.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks with big networks: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin Vahdat (Google Fellow, and head of networking at Google) talked about the importance of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">silicon independence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how P4 can help us accomplish this goal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Najam Ahmad (oversees Facebook’s global network infrastructure) talked about the importance of quick, automated fault-diagnosis in his network, including the rapid addition of new measurement capabilities to gain greater visibility into the networking forwarding plane. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Duell (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVP of New Technology Product Development &amp; Engineering at AT&amp;T) described how his team is writing and deploying P4 programs in their existing network equipment, to increase visibility into the forwarding plane. AT&amp;T is also using P4 to specify forwarding behavior in an RFC. Ken emphasized how important it will be for P4 programs to be portable. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks developing P4 platforms: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon Brebner (Xilinx) explained Xilinx’s interest and investment in P4 as a way to specify how packets should be processed in FPGAs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johann Tönsing (Netronome) described how Netronome uses P4 to define how packets are processed in a programmable NIC. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Mack-Crane (Corsa) described Corsa’s P4 compiler, which builds on the open-source HLIR compiler, for their programmable dataplane systems.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>P4 Demos</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen demos showed a variety of P4 targets running P4 code; ranging from P4 as a front end for Open vSwitch (OVS), to P4 as a front end to FPGA-based routers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Feedback and Future Events</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would love to get your thoughts on the event. Feedback helps us pick the best content, and to invite the best speakers. If you have ANY thoughts at all on the direction of future events, please send an email to </span><a href="mailto:p4@p4.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">p4@p4.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - we will use your ideas to help us shape future events.  Don’t hesitate to suggest improvements on the facilities, the speaker topics, the demos: anything.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d particularly like to solicit your feedback on our hosting an event focused on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">developers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: where people writing P4 code and tools can come together to work through problems and get ideas for future projects.  We are thinking of holding a P4 tutorial at the same event (perhaps the day before) to help new developers get started with P4. If you’d like to volunteer to help, let us know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any other thoughts or want to start a more general discussion with other members of the P4 community, we encourage you to post at </span><a href="mailto:p4-discuss@p4.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">p4-discuss@p4.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="http://mail.p4.org/mailman/listinfo/p4-discuss_p4.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subscribe if you haven’t already</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thanks to our sponsors</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because membership in P4.org is free, we don’t have funds to pay for events. We are therefore very grateful to the five sponsors - Netronome, Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and Barefoot - who enabled us to run the workshop at a world-class facility while keeping the cost low for attendees. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks again to everyone who attended, spoke, and demonstrated. See you at the next P4 event in 2016.</span></p>
