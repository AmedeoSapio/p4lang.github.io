### A presentation by the P4 Language Consortium
    
#### Held at Stanford University on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 

### Registration

TBA

### Agenda

The technical agenda will be announced closer to the workshop date but will include updates from the P4 Working Groups, a keynote address, talks and demos, and a panel discussion.

### Call for Contributions

We are soliciting proposals for talks and demos for the 5th P4 Workshop.  We are particularly interested in talks and demos by people developing P4 code for real systems and deployments, as well as new use cases that take P4 in interesting new directions. We would like to keep the workshop focused on technical content--i.e., talks and demos should be used to showcase P4 in action, and not for product marketing.

Details to be submitted for a talk: Title, Abstract, Bio of the Speaker(s), Speaker(s) Photo, plus any other relevant information (maximum one page).

Details to be submitted for a demo: Title, Abstract, Presenter Name(s), Presenter Organization(s), plus any other relevant information (maximum one page).

To submit a proposal for a talk or demo, please [upload](https://p4workshop18.cs.cornell.edu) a PDF with the details above by April 19, 2018
