### Virtual Machine

We have created a virtual machine that has all of the software needed to complete the developer day exercises already installed. You can either download a virtual machine image or build it from source. Note that both of these procedures can take around 45 minutes depending on the speed of your network connection.

* To download the virtual machine image
    1. Install VirtualBox  
       [https://virtualbox.org](https://virtualbox.org)
    1. Download virtual machine image  
       [P4 Tutorial 2018-06-01.ova](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1f22-DYlUV33DsR88_MeMb4s7-1NX_ams&export=download)
    1. Import virtual machine into VirtualBox  
       Open VirtualBox, select "File > Import Appliance", and navigate to the downloaded file.
    1. Boot virtual machine  
       Select "P4 Tutorial 2018-06-01", and click "Start". 

* To build the virtual machine from source
    1. Install VirtualBox  
       [https://virtualbox.org](https://virtualbox.org)
    1. Install Vagrant  
       [https://vagrantup.com](https://vagrantup.com)
    1. Clone the tutorial repository  
       `$ git clone https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials`
    1. Navigate to the vm directory  
      `$ cd tutorials/vm/`
    1. Build the virtual machine  
      `$ vagrant up`
    
* Final steps  
  After the machine boots, you should have a graphical desktop with
  all required software pre-installed, logged in as username "p4"
  (with password "p4").
    
### Slack

We will use Slack to make it easy for participants to ask the TAs questions.  
* Register at [bit.ly/join-p4-lang-slack](https://bit.ly/join-p4-lang-slack)
* Join the `#d2-2018-spring` channel

### Pigeonhole

We will use Pigeonhole to manage questions during the panel.
* Register at [pigenhole.at](https://pigeonhole.at)
* Enter the event code `P4D2`

* 8:30 - 9:00am
    
    * Technical Set-up for Hands-on Lab

      In order to complete the Developer Day exercises, we will
      distribute a virtual machine with all required software
      installed.

* 9:00 - 9:10am
    
    * Welcome and Introductions

      Speaker: [Nate Foster](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster) (Cornell University)

* 9:10 - 10:30am
    
    * Introduction to Data Plane Programming

      Instructor: [Stephen Ibanez](https://web.stanford.edu/~sibanez) (Stanford University)
    
    * Language Basics

      Instructor: [Stephen Ibanez](https://web.stanford.edu/~sibanez) (Stanford University)
        
      Session 1 will provide a hand-on introduction to P4. Students
      will start by implementing a "Hello World"-style application to
      gain an understanding of P4 concepts. The lesson will
      progressively introduce core language features, such as
      header/metadata types, packet parsers, and controls. By the end
      of this session, students will be able to implement a basic IP
      router.

    * P4 Runtime

      Instructor: [Brian O'Connor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bocon/) (ONF)
    
      Session 2 will cover software tools that are essential to
      developing P4 applications. Students will learn how to invoke
      the the P4 compiler, run the debugger, and start a P4 software
      switch. This session will also introduce the control-plane
      interfaces via P4 Runtime, a protocol-independent API
      auto-generated from the definition of a packet processing
      pipeline written in P4.

    * Keynote: "Revisiting In-Network Control" [Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind) (Washington)

      Abstract: Emerging programmable switches allow for flexible and
      reconfigurable packet processing at line rate. These emerging
      technologies address a key limitation with traditional SDN
      solutions that allow for only custom-plane customization but not
      data-plane customization needed by traffic management protocols
      that perform "in-network" control and per-packet processing.

      Despite their promising new functionality, reconfigurable
      switches are not all-powerful; they have limited state, support
      limited types of operations, and limit per-packet computation in
      order to be able to operate at line rate. In this talk, I
      describe how we can address these limitations by using novel
      approximation techniques and implement previously unrealized
      protocols that require in-network control. Our work thus
      represents a modest step towards enabling a "software defined
      data plane" that provides greater performance and isolation for
      datacenter applications.

    * Monitoring and Debugging

      Instructor: [Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arashloo/) (Princeton University)
        
      Session 3 will focus on a set of labs related to network
      monitoring and debugging. In this session, students will gain a
      deeper understanding of P4 language concepts, including custom
      headers and intrinsic metadata. In the first exercise, students
      will implement Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to set a
      congestion bit in a packet header when the queue depth exceeds a
      threshold. In the second exercise, MRI, students will implement
      a simplified version of In-Band Network Telemetry to track the
      path that packets travel through the network.

    * Advanced Data Structures

      Instructor: [Nate Foster](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster) (Cornell University)    

      Session 4 covers advanced data structures. In this session,
      students will implement two data-plane applications. In the
      first, source routing, end-hosts specify paths through the
      network by using a stack of labels in the packet header. The
      switch must “pop” each label and forward out the appropriate
      interface. In the second, students will implement a network
      calculator. Packets containing arithmetic expressions are sent
      to a switch. The switch will evaluate the expressions, and
      return the results back to the sender.
